Python Flask Web App Playground

___

The idea was to create a local movies database with personal ratings of movies, tv shows, etc
____

This is an attempt to build a Flask Web App.
Current implementation is not completed and working with issues.

Backend is on Python/Flask. 
Front HTML/CSS/JS.
Database is SQLLite

Current issues to be solved:

1. Add Records Page:
   1. Form is not cleared after input
2. All Records Page:
   1. Styles are missing
   2. Delete All Records button is not working
   3. Missing option to remove individual records

Improvements to be done:

1. Validation on existing records by name
2. Option to perform a search of existing records


How to run locally:

1. source /venv/bin/activate
2. export FLASK_ENV=development
3. flask --app app run

To remove all records temporary solution is to run script manually in app.py file
